# Crowd Sourcing?

---
class: center, middle

(anyone?)

---
class: center, middle

Getting other people to do the work!

# When is this a good idea?

# When is this a bad idea?

---
class: center, middle

# OK. OK. OK.

---
class: center, middle

## So you want to leverage the power of the masses to contribute to your super cool map.

---
class: center, middle

# How do you do that again?

# Options include...

## Handle it totally manually.

<pre style="font-size: 16px;">
Dearest Pugsly,

I saw your map of fire hydrants in Los Angeles. Great work!

I noticed that you missed one on 4th &amp; Main.

Can you add it?

Sincerely,
Archibold

# Really not that bad of an option.

---
class: middle

## Straight forward
## Don't have use any service or write any code
## Easy for people to contribute

---
class: center, middle

# But it doesn't really scale.

---

class: center, middle

# Fancy Option!

---

## Build something custom

- Design an interface for people to contribute
- Build a back end service to store this data

<img style="width: 100%; float: right;" src='images/cat_coding.jpg'>

---

# DEMO!

---

## Upside

You can build a really nice interface tailored to your use case.

---

## Downsides

- Takes a lot of work (or a lot of $$$)
- You have to make sure the server doesn't go down.
- Still have the issue of bootstrapping your data set.

# Another option for getting crowd sourced data...

# OpenStreetMap!

## What is OpenStreetMap?

---
class: center, middle

(anyone else?)

---
class: center, middle
## What do we get from OSM?

---

## Two kinds of data in OSM.

- *Where* the thing is.
- *What* the thing is.

---
# *Where* the thing is.

Think latitiude/longitude, size and shape.

We call this the "geometry" of the thing.

---
# *What* the thing is.

Is it a building, tree, street, drinking fountain?

- [Fire Hydrant](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/emergency=fire_hydrant)
- [Road](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway)
- [Drinking Fountain](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=drinking_water)

This information is represented in OSM using "tags".

---

## A single geometry can, and usually does have multiple tags.

- a building
- a restaurant
- vegetarian
- wheelchair accessible
- built in 1932

---

### Tags are often represented as "key=value" pairs.

- [building=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/building=yes)
- [amenity=restaurant](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=restaurant)
- [cuisine=vegetarian](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/cuisine=vegetarian)
- [wheelchair=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/wheelchair=yes)
- [start_date=1932](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/start_date=1932)

---

## And some are more obscure

- [diet=lacto_vegetarian](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/diet=lacto_vegetarian)
- [crop=tea](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/crop=tea)
- [funicular=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/funicular=yes)
