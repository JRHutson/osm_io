# A focused map of just...

##  parks

# Crowd Sourcing?

---
class: center, middle

(anyone?)

---
class: center, middle

Getting other people to do the work!

<img width="100%" src="images/lazy_cat.jpg" />

---
class: center, middle

# When is this a good idea?

---
class: center, middle

# When is this a bad idea?

---

- small dataset
- if you need authoritative data
- good open data sources already exist

---
class: center, middle

# OK. OK. OK.

---
class: center, middle

## So you want to leverage the power of the masses to contribute to your super cool map.

class: center, middle

# How do you do that again?

<img width="100%" src="images/confused_pug.jpg" />

---
class: center, middle

# Options include...

---

## Handle it totally manually.

<pre style="font-size: 16px;">
Dearest Pugsly,

I saw your map of fire hydrants in Los Angeles. Great work!

I noticed that you missed one on 4th &amp; Main.

Can you add it?

Sincerely,
Archibold

# Really not that bad of an option.

---
class: middle

## Straight forward
## Don't have to use any service or write any code
## Easy for people to contribute

---
class: center, middle

# But it doesn't really scale.

---

class: center, middle

# Fancy Option!

---

## Build something custom

- Design an interface for people to contribute
- Build a back end service to store this data

<img style="width: 100%; float: right;" src='images/cat_coding.jpg'>

---

class: center, middle

# DEMO!

---

## Upside

You can build a really nice interface tailored to your use case.

---

## Downsides

- Takes a lot of work (or a lot of $$$)
- You have to make sure the server doesn't go down.
- Still have the issue of bootstrapping your data set.

class: center, middle

# Another option for getting crowd sourced data...

---
class: center, middle

# OpenStreetMap!

<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">www.openstreetmap.org</a>

## What is OpenStreetMap?

---
class: center, middle

(anyone else?)

---
class: center, middle
## What do we get from OSM?

---
class: center, middle

# Much more than just streets and buildings.

---

## Two kinds of data in OSM.

- *Where* the thing is.
- *What* the thing is.

---
# *Where* the thing is...

Think latitiude, longitude, size, and shape.

We call this the "geometry" of the thing.

---
# *What* the thing is...

Is it a building, road, drinking fountain, etc?

- [Fire Hydrant](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/emergency=fire_hydrant)
- [Road](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/highway)
- [Drinking Fountain](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=drinking_water)

Represented in OSM using "tags"

Thus, one *tags* the *geometry*.

---
class: center, middle

# Does that make sense?

<img width="33%" src="images/pug-question.jpg" />

---
class: center, middle

## A single geometry can, and usually does have multiple tags.

---

For example a vegetarian restaurant in a wheelchair accessible building that
was built in 1932 should have these tags:

- a building
- a restaurant
- vegetarian
- wheelchair accessible
- built in 1932

---

### We represent tags precisely as "key=value" pairs.

- [building=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/building=yes)
- [amenity=restaurant](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/amenity=restaurant)
- [cuisine=vegetarian](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/cuisine=vegetarian)
- [wheelchair=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/wheelchair=yes)
- [start_date=1932](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/start_date=1932)

---
class: middle, center

# There are *LOTS* of tags

<a href="https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">taginfo.openstreetmap.org</a>

---

## Some are kind of obscure

- [diet=lacto_vegetarian](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/diet=lacto_vegetarian)
- [crop=tea](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/crop=tea)
- [funicular=yes](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/tags/funicular=yes)

<img width="100%" src="images/kiev-funicular.jpg" />

---
class: middle, center

# So, putting that all together...
---

We can make a crowd sourced map from OSM data provided:

- The data exists in OSM.
- We know the appropriate tags.

---
class: middle, center

### But what if the data isn't already in OSM?

---
class: middle, center

### Depending on the data, that's likely.

---
class: middle, center

# Anyone can contribute to OpenStreetMap.

That's the "crowdsourcing" part.

---
# *You* can contribute to OpenStreetMap.

You can add points directly on the [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org) website.

Or if you are going to be doing a lot of editing, you might prefer a desktop
apps like we have been using for the LA Building Import.

---

# Wait.

## You guys know about the LA Building Import right?

# Mapping on the go

There are mobile apps so you can map things as you walk/bike/hike.

### Android: Vespucci OSM Editor

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android

### iOS: Go Mapp!

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go-map!!/id592990211?mt=8

# Demo!

### Getting the data out

So, now we are ready to go.
